# Exploring-Weather-Trends
The first project in Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

## Summary

In this project, I have analysed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## The tools used in this project

  SQL
  
  Excel

## Extract the data from the database with SQL

I extracted the temperature data for the world as well as for Toronto, Canada with SQL query and exported to csv.

## Evaluate the data on Excel 

Looking at the data, the time frame of temperature data of global and Toronto was not consistent. Thus, to be consistent in the year to have more accurate comparison, I selected the data of Toronto's and global temperature to be the same time frame.

## Working with data

Since yearly temperature fluctuates too much, making it hard to define the trend, I decided to use moving average in order to smooth out the fluctuation and easier to observe the long term trend (10 - year moving average).

## Observations

  * Toronto city has always been colder than global average temperature. Moreover, the difference in temperature between Toronto and the world has been very consistent over time. 
  * Changes in Toronto’s temperatures over time are in line with the changes in the global average. The two lines move in the same pattern, and the similarities in the changing pattern is stable. 
  * Toronto’s average temperature fluctuates more than global.
  * The overall trend of both global and Toronto temperature shows that the world in general, and Toronto in particular, is getting hotter, and this trend has been consistent from 1850 up to 2013.
